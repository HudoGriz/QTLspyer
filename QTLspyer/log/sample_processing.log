Hello :)

Before you start please make sure that all the inputs required are provided and are appropriate for your target organism. Reference data for Saccharomyces cerevisiae is already provided.

  input
  |-- adapters                    # Expects adapters for sequence trimming (.fasta)
  |-- annotation                  # Expects genome annotation (.gtf)
  |-- references                  # Expects genome references (.fasta & .vcf)
  |-- sample_data                 # Expects sample read sequences (.fastq)

When the right inputs have been provided, select the right parameters and press start process. the process can be forced to stop at any time, but the data from current tool will most likely be corrupt. Reruning from the last successful completed step is recommended

More info about the inputs and the variant calling pipeline can be found in Info.

Pro tip: you can run this process gradually by selecting which tools to run.
