The results of the analysis are in addition to plots also provided in form of three data tables. Each of them can be downloaded via the download button.
In the **SNPs** tab the statistic for each detected _SNP_ is provided. The second tab, **QTL - ∆SNP statistic** summarizes the chromosomal positions where _∆SNP_ was above the given threshold. The third tab, **QTL - Q statistic** summarizes the chromosomal positions where _Q'_ was above the given threshold. If no entries are given for the second and third data table it is because there are no chromosomal areas above the set threshold.
